## Introduction

 The geometry involved in two perspective views. These views can be obtained either simultaneously, such as with a stereo rig, or sequentially, where a camera moves in relation to the scene. From a geometric standpoint, these two situations are equivalent. 


Computer vision, a field at the intersection of computer science and image processing, has made remarkable strides in recent years, enabling machines to perceive and understand visual information. One fundamental challenge in computer vision is extracting depth information from 2D images. Accurately estimating the 3D structure and spatial relationships of objects in a scene is crucial for applications such as autonomous navigation, augmented reality, object recognition, and robotics.

Stereopsis, the ability of humans and some animals to perceive depth using binocular vision, has inspired researchers to develop techniques for depth perception in computer vision systems. Epipolar geometry, a fundamental concept in stereo vision, provides a mathematical framework for understanding the relationship between two views of a scene captured by two cameras.

The term "epipolar" refers to the lines of intersection between the image planes of two cameras and the 3D scene they observe. Epipolar geometry leverages the geometric constraints imposed by these lines to establish correspondences between corresponding points in the two images. By analyzing the epipolar geometry, we can determine the relative position and orientation of the cameras and reconstruct the 3D structure of the scene.

This blog post aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of epipolar geometry in computer vision. We will delve into the fundamental concepts and mathematical formulations involved in understanding and estimating epipolar geometry. Additionally, we will explore the practical applications of epipolar geometry, such as stereo vision, 3D reconstruction, camera calibration, structure from motion, and visual odometry.

In the subsequent sections, we will first establish the basics of stereopsis and discuss the fundamentals of epipolar geometry, including the epipolar constraint, epipolar lines, epipoles, essential matrix, and fundamental matrix. We will then delve into methods for estimating epipolar geometry, focusing on point correspondences and algorithms like the normalized eight-point algorithm and RANSAC.

Furthermore, we will explore the wide range of applications that benefit from epipolar geometry, including stereo vision for depth perception and 3D reconstruction, camera calibration for accurate measurements, structure from motion to recover 3D structure and camera motion, and visual odometry for ego-motion estimation.

Finally, we will examine epipolar rectification, a technique that simplifies stereo matching by transforming the images into a common coordinate system. We will discuss the rectification process, rectification matrices, and the effects of rectification on stereo vision.

By the end of this blog post, readers will have gained a solid understanding of the principles of epipolar geometry and its significance in various computer vision applications. They will appreciate how epipolar geometry provides a powerful toolset for extracting depth information and accurately analyzing the 3D structure of the world from multiple viewpoints.
