## Introduction

In the world of computer graphics, there's a fascinating process called the graphics pipeline. It's like a factory assembly line, but instead of producing physical objects, it creates the stunning images we see on our screens. Let's break it down into simpler terms.

The graphics pipeline works by taking geometric shapes, like triangles or squares, and transforming them into pixels on our screen. Imagine starting with a bunch of dots in space, representing the corners of these shapes. The pipeline then does some math to figure out where each dot should go on the screen, making sure everything lines up perfectly.

Once the dots are in the right place, the pipeline moves on to rasterization. This step is like coloring in a coloring book: it figures out which dots are inside each shape and fills them in with color. It also blends colors together where shapes overlap.

After rasterization, the pipeline adds some finishing touches to each pixel, making sure they look just right. Finally, all the pixels come together to create the complete image we see on our screen.

The graphics pipeline is used in everything from video games to movie special effects, making it a crucial part of modern technology. In the next sections, we'll take a closer look at each step of the pipeline, breaking it down into easy-to-understand concepts and exploring how it brings virtual worlds to life.
