description: "Writing is my way of thinking. When I put an idea into words, I gain clarity, uncover gaps in my understanding, and solidify concepts. This blog is where I document my explorations in Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, and Deep Learning. In the future, I’ll also dive into Theoretical Physics and the mathematics that underpins it. In the Processed Paper series, I distill research papers into clear, concise insights—preserving the core ideas while removing the complexity."
