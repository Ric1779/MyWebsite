## Introduction
---
Welcome to my exploration of rasterization, the unsung hero of 3D rendering! While ray tracing often steals the spotlight, rasterization quietly powers the graphics you see in most 3D applications and games today. Yet, despite its prevalence, rasterization remains shrouded in mystery for many.

Why is this the case? Well, rasterization hails from the early days of computer graphics, a time often overshadowed by the glitz and glamour of modern technology. But don't let its age fool you; rasterization is far from obsolete. In fact, it forms the backbone of GPU rendering, the technology driving today's visual experiences.

So why the lack of understanding? Perhaps it's because rasterization operates behind the scenes, woven deep into the fabric of hardware architecture. While GPU designers may grasp its intricacies, for the rest of us, demystifying rasterization can feel like cracking a code.

That's where I come in. Inspired by a quest for clarity, drawing from a wealth of resources, including an invaluable [{{< mathjax/inline>}}<span style="color: #ffa700;">online book</span>{{< /mathjax/inline>}}](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/rasterization-practical-implementation/overview-rasterization-algorithm.html), I'm here to shed light on this essential rendering technique. In the pages that follow, I'll guide you through the inner workings of rasterization, from its humble origins to its indispensable role in modern graphics. Together, we'll explore the fundamental principles that underpin this algorithm and demystify its implementation.

This isn't just theory; it's about getting hands-on with rasterization, learning the essentials step by step. We'll dive into the core of rasterization, ready to tackle real-world rendering tasks. Plus, as we go, we might discover some neat tricks that change the way we think about computer graphics! Whether you're completely new to 3D rendering or just starting out on your journey, come along as we explore the fundamentals of rasterization. Together, we'll uncover the basics, making graphics knowledge more accessible and understandable for beginners.

## Foundational Principles of Rasterization
---
Before we dive into the intricacies of rasterization, it's essential to grasp its foundational principles. Rasterization, at its core, is the process of converting vector graphics or 3D models into raster images composed of pixels. This transformation is fundamental to the rendering pipeline, enabling the visualization of complex scenes in computer graphics.

At its most basic level, rasterization involves breaking down continuous geometric shapes, such as triangles representing 3D surfaces, into discrete pixel elements. Each pixel on the screen corresponds to a specific location in the rendered image, and the color or attributes of that pixel are determined based on the geometry it covers.

One key concept in rasterization is the edge function, which helps determine whether a pixel lies inside or outside a geometric primitive, such as a triangle. By evaluating the relative positions of vertices and pixels, rasterization algorithms can efficiently determine pixel coverage and attribute interpolation.

Anti-aliasing techniques are another crucial aspect of rasterization, aimed at reducing visual artifacts such as jagged edges or pixelation. Through methods like sub-pixel sampling and coverage testing, anti-aliasing enhances the smoothness and fidelity of rendered images.

Additionally, optimizing rasterization algorithms for performance is a constant endeavor in computer graphics. Techniques such as block-based rendering and fixed-point coordinates help improve efficiency and speed up the rendering process, making real-time graphics rendering feasible for applications like video games and simulations.

## 2D Triangle Bounding Boxes
---
In our journey to understand rasterization, we've delved into the foundational principles of this essential rendering technique. Now, armed with a deeper understanding of rasterization's inner workings, we're ready to optimize the process and unleash its full potential.

At the heart of rasterization lies a crucial optimization strategy: the utilization of 2D triangle bounding boxes. In our previous discussions, we highlighted the inefficiency of naively iterating over all pixels in the image, regardless of whether they intersect with the rendered triangles. This approach becomes increasingly impractical as the complexity of the scene grows, with potentially hundreds to millions of triangles vying for screen space.

Enter the 2D bounding box—a powerful tool for streamlining the rasterization process. By computing the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the projected triangle's vertices in raster space, we can encapsulate the triangle within a bounding box. This bounding box serves as a spatial filter, allowing us to focus our attention solely on the pixels within its bounds.

The process of computing the 2D bounding box is remarkably straightforward. We project the vertices of the triangle onto the canvas, convert them to raster space, and identify the extremities of the resulting bounding box. Armed with these coordinates, we can confine our pixel iteration to the confines of the bounding box, bypassing unnecessary computations and significantly boosting performance.

But optimization doesn't stop there. We must also contend with the nuances of raster coordinates, ensuring proper handling of vertices that project outside the canvas boundaries. By clamping pixel coordinates within the valid range and rounding bounding box coordinates to the nearest integer value, we ensure robustness and accuracy in our calculations.

As we embark on this journey of optimization, it's essential to acknowledge that production-grade rasterizers employ even more efficient methods. While our focus remains on the fundamental principles, we recognize the vast landscape of optimization techniques waiting to be explored.

Looking ahead, we'll continue our exploration of rasterization, delving deeper into z-buffer, coordinate transformations and the intricacies of triangle rasterization. With each step, we inch closer to mastery, armed with the knowledge and tools to tackle real-world rendering challenges.

<!-- In the next chapter, we'll unravel the mysteries of coordinate transformations, shedding light on the intricate dance between camera and raster space. Join us as we navigate this intricate terrain, paving the way for smoother, more efficient rendering pipelines. -->

## Z-buffer/ Depth-buffer
---
As we navigate the intricacies of rasterization, a critical consideration emerges: the z-coordinate's pivotal role in determining depth accuracy. In our exploration of projecting vertices from camera space to raster space, we encounter the challenge of reconciling identical raster coordinates for vertices with differing depths.

Imagine two vertices, P1 and P2, projected onto the canvas with identical raster coordinates. If P1 lies closer to the camera than P2, it should rightfully take precedence in the rendered image. However, without accounting for depth, P2 may erroneously overshadow P1, leading to visual inaccuracies.

To address this challenge, a nuanced approach is introduced: incorporating the z-coordinate of vertices into our depth assessment. By tracking the vertex z-coordinate alongside its 2D raster coordinates, we gain insight into each vertex's relative position in camera space.

Consider the scenario depicted in Figure 1. Through diligent z-coordinate tracking, we discern the true spatial relationship between vertices P1 and P2, ensuring accurate depth representation. Leveraging the z-coordinate, we ascertain which vertex occupies the foremost position along the z-axis, thus guiding our visibility determination.

{{< rawhtml>}}
<p align="center">
  <img src="../images/rasterization/depth-buffer-2.png" alt="Image description" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 75%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px; width: 100%"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Figure 1: When a pixel overlaps several triangles, we can use the point's z-coordinate on the triangle to determine which one of these triangles is closest to the camera.</em>
</p>
{{< /rawhtml>}}

In the code snippet, we witness this principle in action, comparing the z-coordinates of vertices P1 and P2 to discern their relative depth. This meticulous depth evaluation empowers us to render scenes with fidelity, preserving spatial integrity even amidst complex geometry.

```cpp
float *depthBuffer = new float[imageWidth * imageHeight];
// Initialize the depth-buffer with a very large number
for (uint32_t y = 0; y < imageHeight; ++y)
    for (uint32_t x = 0; x < imageWidth; ++x)
        depthBuffer[y * imageWidth + x] = INFINITY;

for (each triangle in the scene) {
    // Project triangle vertices
    ...
    // Compute the 2D triangle bounding-box
    ...
    for (uint32_t y = bbox.min.y; y <= bbox.max.y; ++y) {
        for (uint32_t x = bbox.min.x; x <= bbox.max.x; ++x) {
            if (pixelOverlapsTriangle(x + 0.5, y + 0.5)) {
                // Compute the z-coordinate of the point on the triangle surface
                float z = computeDepth(...);
                // The current point is closer than the object stored in the depth/frame-buffer
                if (z < depthBuffer[y * imageWidth + x]) {
                     // Update the depth-buffer with that depth
                     depthBuffer[y * imageWidth + x] = z;
                     frameBuffer[y * imageWidth + x] = triangleColor;
                }
            }
        } 
    } 
}
```

While our focus extends beyond individual vertices to encompass entire triangles, the essence remains consistent. Just as we scrutinize vertex depth, we extrapolate this principle to triangles, calculating the z-coordinate of points along their surfaces. This nuanced approach enables us to navigate overlapping triangles with precision, discerning the closest triangle to the camera's viewpoint.

## From World Space to Raster Space
---
Central to rasterization is the transformation of coordinates from world space, where objects are defined, to raster space, where pixels are rendered onto the screen. In the provided code snippet, the function `convertToRaster` performs this crucial transformation. Let's delve into each step:

```cpp
void convertToRaster(...)
{
    Vec3f vertexCamera;

    worldToCamera.multVecMatrix(vertexWorld, vertexCamera);
    
    // convert to screen space
    Vec2f vertexScreen;
    vertexScreen.x = near * vertexCamera.x / -vertexCamera.z;
    vertexScreen.y = near * vertexCamera.y / -vertexCamera.z;
    
    // now convert point from screen space to NDC space (in range [-1,1])
    Vec2f vertexNDC;
    vertexNDC.x = 2 * vertexScreen.x / (r - l) - (r + l) / (r - l);
    vertexNDC.y = 2 * vertexScreen.y / (t - b) - (t + b) / (t - b);

    // convert to raster space
    vertexRaster.x = (vertexNDC.x + 1) / 2 * imageWidth;
    // in raster space y is down so invert direction
    vertexRaster.y = (1 - vertexNDC.y) / 2 * imageHeight;
    vertexRaster.z = -vertexCamera.z;
}
```

#### World to Camera Space

The first transformation occurs when the vertex coordinates are converted from world space to camera space. This step is essential for simulating the perspective effect of a virtual camera observing the scene. It involves multiplying the vertex coordinates by the world-to-camera transformation matrix `worldToCamera`. The resulting `vertexCamera` represents the position of the vertex relative to the camera.

```cpp
worldToCamera.multVecMatrix(vertexWorld, vertexCamera);
```

#### Screen Space Projection

Once in camera space, the vertices are projected onto a virtual screen located at the near clipping plane. This projection accounts for perspective distortion, where objects farther from the camera appear smaller. The `vertexScreen` coordinates are calculated using the perspective projection equations:

```cpp
vertexScreen.x = near * vertexCamera.x / -vertexCamera.z;
vertexScreen.y = near * vertexCamera.y / -vertexCamera.z;
```

#### Normalized Device Coordinates

The next step is to transform the coordinates from screen space to Normalized Device Coordinates (NDC), a standardized coordinate system used in computer graphics. NDC coordinates range from -1 to 1 along each axis, with (-1, -1) at the bottom-left corner and (1, 1) at the top-right corner of the screen. This transformation ensures that objects within the viewing frustum are mapped uniformly.

```cpp
vertexNDC.x = 2 * vertexScreen.x / (r - l) - (r + l) / (r - l);
vertexNDC.y = 2 * vertexScreen.y / (t - b) - (t + b) / (t - b);
```

#### Raster Space Conversion

Finally, the NDC coordinates are converted to raster space, which corresponds to the pixel coordinates of the final image. This conversion involves scaling the coordinates to fit within the dimensions of the image, with the y-axis inverted to match the convention of raster graphics.

```cpp
vertexRaster.x = (vertexNDC.x + 1) / 2 * imageWidth;
vertexRaster.y = (1 - vertexNDC.y) / 2 * imageHeight;
vertexRaster.z = -vertexCamera.z; // Retaining depth information
```

By following these transformation steps, vertices originally defined in world space are accurately projected onto the screen in raster space, ready for further processing such as triangle rasterization and pixel shading.

<!-- ## Raster Space

With vertices projected onto the canvas and their coordinates seamlessly translated to raster space, our journey through the rasterization algorithm progresses. Now, armed with a comprehensive understanding of the coordinate transformations involved, we stand poised to navigate the convergence of pixels and triangles within a unified coordinate system.

As we transition from NDC space to raster space, our objective crystallizes: to reconcile the nuanced conventions governing coordinate representation, ensuring seamless integration into the rasterization pipeline. This pivotal step heralds the convergence of disparate coordinate realms, culminating in a cohesive canvas ripe for pixel-triangle intersection analysis.

## Edge Function in Rasterization
---
In rasterization, the process of converting geometric shapes into pixels for display on a screen or other output device—an essential component is the determination of whether a given pixel lies within a polygon. While there are various techniques to accomplish this task, one method that stands out for its efficiency and elegance is the edge function introduced by Juan Pineda in his seminal 1988 paper, "A Parallel Algorithm for Polygon Rasterization."

**Principle Behind the Edge Function**

At its core, Pineda's method hinges on the concept of using a function to discern the spatial relationship between a point and the edges of a polygon. Imagine each edge of a triangle as a line segment that divides the 2D plane into two regions. The goal is to devise a function—aptly named the edge function—that, when evaluated with a given point, yields a positive value if the point lies to the right of the line, a negative value if it's to the left, and zero if it coincides with the line itself.

By applying this method to all three edges of a triangle, we can identify a region where the edge function returns positive values for all points within it. This region represents the interior of the triangle. Thus, by evaluating the edge function for a pixel located within this region, we can ascertain whether the pixel falls within the triangle.

**Mathematical Formulation**

The edge function, as defined by Pineda, takes three vertices of an edge as input and calculates a scalar value that encapsulates the relative position of a point to that edge. In 2D space, this function can be expressed as:

```cpp
float edgeFunction(const Vec2f &a, const Vec2f &b, const Vec2f &c) {
    return ((c.x - a.x) * (b.y - a.y) - (c.y - a.y) * (b.x - a.x));
}
```
a and b are two points on the line and c is the pixel coordinate being checked. This formulation leverages the determinant of a 2x2 matrix constructed from vectors formed by the vertices, yielding a value that signifies the orientation of the point with respect to the edge.

**Implementation and Application**

In practical terms, the edge function facilitates the determination of whether a pixel lies within a polygon. By evaluating the function for each edge of the polygon and a given pixel, we can ascertain the pixel's interiority. If the function returns positive values for all edges, the pixel resides inside the polygon.

```cpp
bool inside = true;
inside &= edgeFunction(V0, V1, p);
inside &= edgeFunction(V1, V2, p);
inside &= edgeFunction(V2, V0, p);

if (inside) {
    // Point p is inside the triangle defined by vertices V0, V1, V2
    ...
}
```

**Optimizations and Further Reading**

One notable property of the edge function is its linearity, a feature explored further in Pineda's paper for algorithmic optimization. This linearity enables parallel execution, making it conducive to hardware implementations such as GPU rendering.

For those interested in delving deeper into the intricacies of rasterization algorithms and optimizations, Pineda's original paper provides valuable insights, including optimizations exploiting the linearity property for parallel processing.

In conclusion, the edge function serves as a fundamental building block in rasterization algorithms, enabling efficient determination of pixel-polygon relationships and contributing to the immersive visual experiences we enjoy in computer graphics applications.

## Barycentric Coordinates in Rasterization
---
Barycentric coordinates play a pivotal role in rasterization algorithms, offering a powerful tool for determining the properties of points within a triangle. While not strictly necessary for basic rasterization, understanding barycentric coordinates enriches our grasp of the process and enables sophisticated rendering techniques.

In its essence, a set of barycentric coordinates comprises three floating-point numbers, conventionally denoted as {{< mathjax/inline>}}\(\lambda_0\){{< /mathjax/inline>}}, {{< mathjax/inline>}}\(\lambda_1\){{< /mathjax/inline>}}, and {{< mathjax/inline>}}\(\lambda_2\){{< /mathjax/inline>}}. These coordinates define any point within a triangle, with each value representing the weight or contribution of a corresponding vertex to the point's position.

The key attributes of barycentric coordinates are:

1. **Range and Constraints**: While barycentric coordinates can technically assume any value, for points inside or on the edges of a triangle, they typically range from 0 to 1. Moreover, the sum of the three coordinates always equals 1.

2. **Interpolation and Weighting**: Barycentric coordinates facilitate interpolation across the triangle's surface, enabling the blending of attributes such as color, normal vectors, or texture coordinates defined at each vertex. This interpolation occurs linearly between vertices, with the coordinates acting as weights.

3. **Calculation Method**: The determination of barycentric coordinates is relatively straightforward. One approach involves leveraging the edge function, which calculates the signed area of the parallelogram defined by vectors formed by pairs of triangle vertices. By dividing these areas, we obtain normalized barycentric coordinates.

4. **Applications**: Barycentric coordinates find extensive use in computer graphics, particularly in shading triangles. They allow for the interpolation of vertex attributes, facilitating smooth shading and realistic rendering effects.

Understanding barycentric coordinates enhances our ability to manipulate and analyze geometry during the rasterization process. By leveraging these coordinates, we can efficiently determine properties such as point positions, colors, and other attributes within triangles, paving the way for visually compelling graphics rendering.

## Correcting Depth Interpolation
---
Depth interpolation is essential for determining the depth of a point on the surface of a triangle accurately. However, simply linearly interpolating the z-coordinates of the original vertices using barycentric coordinates doesn't yield the desired results due to perspective projection's non-linear nature. To address this, we need to interpolate the inverse z-coordinates of the vertices and then invert the result to find the depth of the point.

**Process**:

1. **Interpolating the Inverse Z-Coordinates:**
   - Compute the inverse of the z-coordinate for each vertex of the triangle.
   - Use barycentric coordinates to interpolate these inverse z-coordinates to find the inverse of the depth of the point on the triangle's surface.

2. **Inverting the Result:**
   - After interpolating the inverse depths, invert the result to find the actual depth of the point.
   - This step ensures that we account for perspective projection's non-linear distortion.

```cpp
v0Raster.z = 1 / v0Raster.z,
v1Raster.z = 1 / v1Raster.z,
v2Raster.z = 1 / v2Raster.z;
```

<!-- To understand this process more formally, let's consider a line defined by two vertices in camera space. We project these vertices onto the screen, creating corresponding points on the 2D line. By defining parameters for these points, we can express their coordinates in terms of the original vertices' coordinates and their barycentric coordinates.

**Equation**:

{{< mathjax/inline>}}\[ \lambda_1 = \frac{{\frac{1}{V_{0z}} - \frac{1}{V_{1z}}}}{{\frac{1}{V_{0z}} - \frac{1}{V_{2z}}}} \]{{< /mathjax/inline>}}

{{< mathjax/inline>}}\[ \lambda_2 = \frac{{\frac{1}{V_{0z}} - \frac{1}{V_{2z}}}}{{\frac{1}{V_{0z}} - \frac{1}{V_{1z}}}} \]{{< /mathjax/inline>}}

Where:
- {{< mathjax/inline>}}\( V_{0z} \), \( V_{1z} \), and \( V_{2z} \){{< /mathjax/inline>}} are the z-coordinates of the original vertices.
- {{< mathjax/inline>}}\( \lambda_1 \) and \( \lambda_2 \){{< /mathjax/inline>}} are the barycentric coordinates of the projected point.

By correctly interpolating the inverse z-coordinates of the vertices and inverting the result, we ensure accurate depth computation for points on a triangle's surface. This method accounts for the non-linear distortion introduced by perspective projection, resulting in more realistic rendering of 3D scenes. -->


### Rendering a Checkered Cow with Rasterization

Now that we've covered the fundamental concepts of rasterization, let's put everything into practice by rendering a 3D model of a cow with a checkered pattern. We'll utilize the techniques we've discussed, including coordinate transformation, edge functions, barycentric coordinates, and depth interpolation.

First, we need a 3D model of a cow represented by vertices and triangles. We'll include this information in a header file (.h) for easy inclusion in our rendering code. Here's how the header file might look:

```cpp
// cow.h
uint32_t nvertices[9468] = {
2, 0, 3, 1, 3, 0, 4, 2, 
5, 3, 5, 2, 6, 4, 7, 5, 
.
.
.
uint32_t stindices[9468] = {
0, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 11, 0, 
5, 2, 5, 0, 27, 11, 17, 5, 
17, 11, 35, 48, 27, 27, 17, 35, 
.
.
```

Now let's integrate this cow model into our rasterization code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <chrono>
#include "cow.h" // Include the cow model

// Include other necessary code snippets

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    // Define constants and variables

    // Matrix44f cameraToWorld = worldToCamera.inverse();

    // Compute screen coordinates

    // Define the frame-buffer and the depth-buffer. Initialize depth buffer

    auto t_start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

    // Outer loop
    for (uint32_t i = 0; i < cowTriangles.size(); ++i) {
        const Vertex &v0 = cowVertices[cowTriangles[i].indices[0]];
        const Vertex &v1 = cowVertices[cowTriangles[i].indices[1]];
        const Vertex &v2 = cowVertices[cowTriangles[i].indices[2]];

        // Convert the vertices of the triangle to raster space

        // Precompute reciprocal of vertex z-coordinate

        // Prepare vertex attributes

        // Compute bounding box

        // Inner loop
        for (uint32_t y = y0; y <= y1; ++y) {
            for (uint32_t x = x0; x <= x1; ++x) {
                // Compute barycentric coordinates

                if (w0 >= 0 && w1 >= 0 && w2 >= 0) {
                    // Interpolate attributes

                    // Depth-buffer test

                    // Compute final color with checkered pattern

                    // Update frame buffer
                }
            }
        }
    }

    auto t_end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    auto passedTime = std::chrono::duration<double, std::milli>(t_end - t_start).count();
    std::cerr << "Wall passed time:  " << passedTime << " ms" << std::endl;

    // Store the result of the framebuffer to a PPM file

    return 0;
}
```

In this code snippet, we include the `cow.h` header file which contains the vertex and triangle data of our cow model. Inside the main loop, we iterate through each triangle of the cow, convert its vertices to raster space, perform depth testing, and apply the checkered pattern based on barycentric coordinates.

  <em>Figure 2: Final Render</em>

With this integrated code, you'll be able to render a checkered cow using rasterization techniques. Feel free to customize the cow model and the checkered pattern to suit your needs. Happy rendering!

## Enhancing the Rasterization Algorithm
---
Now that we have explored the fundamentals of perspective correct interpolation and vertex attributes, it's time to discuss ways to enhance the rasterization algorithm further. While the code presented thus far is functional, there is always room for improvement in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and versatility.

1. **Sub-pixel Rasterization**: One enhancement involves sub-pixel rasterization, which aims to improve the accuracy of rendering by considering fractional pixel coverage. Traditional rasterization techniques only consider whether a pixel is covered by a triangle or not. Sub-pixel rasterization takes into account the partial coverage of pixels, resulting in smoother edges and more accurate rendering, especially for high-resolution displays.

2. **Multisampling**: Multisampling is another technique used to improve the quality of rendered images. It involves sampling multiple points within each pixel and averaging the results to determine the final color. By sampling at multiple points, multisampling reduces aliasing artifacts such as jagged edges, resulting in smoother images, particularly in areas of high contrast or fine detail.

3. **Depth Buffer Optimization**: Optimizing the depth buffer can significantly improve rendering performance, especially in scenes with complex geometry. Techniques such as hierarchical depth buffering, z-buffer compression, and early depth testing can reduce memory bandwidth and processing overhead, leading to faster rendering times without sacrificing image quality.

4. **Parallelization**: Leveraging parallel processing techniques, such as multi-threading or GPU acceleration, can greatly accelerate the rasterization process, enabling real-time rendering of complex scenes. By distributing rendering tasks across multiple cores or GPU compute units, parallelization reduces latency and increases throughput, resulting in smoother animation and interactive user experiences.

5. **Shader Optimization**: Finally, optimizing shaders can enhance the visual quality and efficiency of rendering pipelines. Techniques such as loop unrolling, instruction scheduling, and register allocation can minimize the computational overhead of shading operations, improving frame rates and reducing power consumption on mobile and battery-powered devices.

By incorporating these enhancements into the rasterization algorithm, developers can achieve more realistic, immersive, and interactive 3D graphics experiences across a wide range of platforms and applications. While implementing these techniques may require additional programming effort and computational resources, the benefits in terms of visual quality and performance justify the investment, particularly in applications where rendering fidelity is paramount.
