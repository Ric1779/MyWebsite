Hello there!👋 I'm Richards Britto, a Computer Vision enthusiast deeply passionate about exploring the exciting territories of 3D scene reconstruction and SLAM. Armed with a freshly earned master’s degree in Image Analysis and Machine Learning from Uppsala University, I dive headfirst into the world of technology. Beyond my tech pursuits, I lead a well-rounded life as a versatile athlete. You might catch me on the field, representing the fifth division football club, IK Apollon ⚽, or dedicating myself to strength training with powerlifting, boulder climbing, and calisthenics🏋🏽🤸🏽. 

Furthermore, I've a passion for 3D modeling, sketching, autonomous driving, CG, and XR. I also proudly wield a lightning-fast typing speed of [110 WPM](https://monkeytype.com/profile/Ric1779)⚡, a skill finely honed over a century of intense focus, secluded in the sanctum of a digital temple 🧘🏽. It's this blend of technical prowess, diverse interests, and a relentless drive for improvement that fuels my journey in the ever-evolving landscape of technology and innovation.

During my leisure hours, I immerse myself in philosophical discourse, often exploring the intricacies of the cosmos🛸 and delving into the fundamental truths of existence. These pursuits are not just hobbies but cherished endeavors that deeply satisfy my soul. Whether I'm engrossed in philosophical discussions or captivated by thought-provoking videos on YouTube, these activities provide a sanctuary from the demands of daily life and encourage me to explore boundless realms of thought and imagination.💡

In contemplating life's grand questions, I've come to believe that the only antidote to nihilism is to trick our brains into becoming obsessed with something meaningful. Whether it's delving into the intricacies of computer vision or delving into the depths of human emotions, finding purpose in our pursuits is essential. For me, it's the fusion of technology, athleticism, and philosophical inquiry that ignites my passion and drives me forward. Through this journey, I've discovered that the pursuit of excellence and the cultivation of meaningful connections with others are the true essence of a fulfilled existence.😁
