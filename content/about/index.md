Hello there!👋 I'm Richards Britto, a Computer Vision enthusiast deeply passionate about exploring the exciting territories of 3D scene reconstruction and SLAM. Armed with a freshly earned master’s degree in Image Analysis and Machine Learning from Uppsala University, I dive headfirst into the world of technology. Beyond my tech pursuits, I lead a well-rounded life as a versatile athlete. You might catch me on the field, representing the fifth division football club, IK Apollon ⚽, or dedicating myself to strength training with powerlifting, boulder climbing, and calisthenics🏋🏽🤸🏽. 

Furthermore, I've a passion for 3D modeling, sketching, autonomous driving, CG, and XR. On top of that, I proudly wield a lightning-fast typing speed of [110 WPM](https://monkeytype.com/profile/Ric1779)⚡, a skill finely honed over a century of intense focus, secluded in the sanctum of a digital temple 🧘🏽. It's this blend of technical prowess, diverse interests, and a relentless drive for improvement that fuels my journey in the ever-evolving landscape of technology and innovation.
